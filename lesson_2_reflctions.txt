What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates .git folder with the initial metadata for the repo. It is needed to tell git that this will be a new repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is destinated only to changes to be committed, the working directory contains all the files/changes but they are not necessarily meant to be committed.
