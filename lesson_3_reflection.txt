When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When more than one person is working on the project, when you want to backup your data on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
More control over the code, it means I will pull when is really needed.
