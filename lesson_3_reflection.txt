When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When more than one person is working on the project, when you want to backup your data on the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
More control over the code, it means I will pull when is really needed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks = exclusive to github.
Clones = copies of local repos.
branches = alternative versions of a project within the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You are up to date with the remote repo, and can work offline from there.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It will be will a private server and It would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I would make changes in a separate branch when working on some experimental stuff for example, and to be sure to not interfere with the other people working on the project, so when the change in done and ready issue a pull request, so everybody is informed about it.
